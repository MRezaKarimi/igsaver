## Known Issues
`User-Agent` parameter in request headers set to `Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:79.0)` to prevent redirecting to login page.
However, after multiple try to download profile, Instagram redirects requests to login page and download profile not working any more.

Due to Android limitations on reading clipboard contents when app is running in the background, clipboard monitor and auto-download only works on Android 9 and below.
